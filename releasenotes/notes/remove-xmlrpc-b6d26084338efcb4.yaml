    To simplify the code base, the XML-RPC API has been removed. This
    means that `pwclient` will no longer work.

    As a result, `tools/patchwork-update-commits` and
    `tools/post-receive.hook` have also been removed.

    Users are encouraged to try
    `git-pw <https://github.com/getpatchwork/git-pw>`_.
